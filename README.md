# python-for-everybody-exercises
 
On the 16/03/2022 I started learning Python and I am using two resources:
 - [freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)
 - [Python for Everybody Book](http://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf)

I am using this repository to store the solutions to the exercises in the book.

## Install and Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Clone the repo.

Then open the repo in your favourite code editor.

Open the terminal, while in the root directory of the repo type `python` followed by the name of the file you want to run, for example, if you want to run the script for the exercises number 1 in chapter 3 run in the terminal:

``` 
python 3_1.py
```
